==== Towards open source libraries for GIMI

This section presents findings of prototyping GIMI support in a selection of open source libraries. The prototyping and assessment was carried out by Brad Hards.

Prior to the code sprint, a selection of GIMI files were produced using a custom application. The application used open data provided by the Australian Capital
Territory (ACT) Government under a CC-BY license. The source format was GeoTIFF, and the resulting GIMI files used HEVC (H.265), JPEG 2000, and uncompressed
encodings. Non-standard JPEG and AV1 (AVIF) files were also produced, along with a sample that did not include security metadata and a sample that did not
include corner points.

Additional files were produced during the sprint from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data in NITF-formatted Sensor Independent Derived Data (SIDD) format, sourced
from Capella Space via the AWS Open Data Program, also under a CC-BY license.

These GIMI files were read back in using modified versions of libheif and GDAL,
where GDAL already used libheif for image content, but required an external "sidecar" PAM file to provide any geopositioning or associated metadata.

The changes to libheif were to support metadata that is not attached to an image item. This occurs in GIMI files for the security metadata, which is scoped to the entire
HEIF file content. The changes included suppressing a parsing error and exposing the resulting metadata item through the libheif API.

The changes to GDAL were to support the security metadata as a GDAL metadata item, and to use the KLV metadata as a GDAL metadata item, and also to provide
corner point geopositioning. The changes to libheif enabled access to the security metadata. With these changes, GDAL was able to extract and expose the additional GIMI
metadata without use of sidecar files. An example showing the GIMI-specific metadata domains, along with GCPs and the derived coordinate system transformation, is 
shown below.

GDAL serves as a key component within the geospatial software ecosystem, with broad direct and indirect use by a wide range of open source and proprietary software.
A view of the ecosystem is shown below, with components higher in the stack reliant on capabilities provided by components lower in the stack.

[[img_ecosystem]]

As noted above, libheif and GDAL were modified to expose GIMI features within existing GDAL interfaces. This allows use of these features by existing software, often without change.
An example is shown in <<img_gimi_qgis_1>>, which is a screenshot of an unmodified version of QGIS displaying two GIMI test files (using different compression methods), overlaid on top of OpenStreetMap.
A small script is running in the QGIS Python console to extract the XML-encoded security metadata and provide an on-screen, human-readable, color-coded representation of the key aspects of the
security data.

Similarly, rebuilding rasterio against the modified GDAL library makes the GIMI features available within a Python context.
The sprint participants created a Jupyter Notebook, shown in <<img_gimi_jupyter_1>> and <<img_gimi_jupyter_2>>, that used rasterio to perform basic analysis / data science on GIMI imagery files.
Note that this required development of the notebook, but there were no changes to rasterio or to the general design of the Juypter notebook specific to GIMI or HEIF. Instead, the
abstraction provided by GDAL meant that the notebook could basically follow the rasterio introductory tutorial.

In addition to custom development, there are a wide range of open source geospatial tools written in Python that make heavy use of rasterio for raster processing. An example of this is
pygeoapi. Installing pygeoapi with the local copy of rasterio was required to ensure that a second copy of the rasterio stack (including GDAL) was not used. Configuring pygeoapi with
a GIMI file as a dataset was the only other activity required to serve the GIMI file in a range of formats, including as an OGC API - Coverages endpoint. A screenshot of the bounds,
domain set and ranges of a coverage from a GIMI file on pygeoapi is shown in <<img_gimi_pygeoapi_coverage>>.

[[img_gimi_pygeoapi_coverage]]

image::images/gimi/gimi_pygeoapi_coverage.png[]

That coverage endpoint could then be used with the open-source TiTiler application to dynamically generate tiles at various zoom levels. Like pygeoapi, TiTiler also uses
rasterio, and only required minor install-time customization to use the local copy of the rasterio stack (including the modified GDAL and libheif versions). No code
changes were required. With this installation, TiTiler served raster tiles in a range of formats, including as an OGC API - Tiles endpoint.

Those raster tiles could then be displayed in a web map such as OpenLayers as shown in <<img_gimi_openlayers>>.

In conclusion, the sprint participants found that with some changes to libheif and GDAL, a wide range of software can quickly and simply make use of GIMI capabilities, including
making those available in standards-compliant OGC API services. However, to fully 
unlock those GIMI capabilities, the base libraries will need to ship with the required functionality "out of the box", including:

 - comprehensive codec support (noting that AVC/H.264 and High Throughput JPEG 2000 are not supported in libheif at this time);
 - a finalized version of the geolocation metadata;
 - flexible support for security metadata;
 - support for overviews, grid representation, and byte range requests (equivalent to Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF);
 - GIMI writing support within GDAL;
 - unit testing and integration testing with a wider range of sample data; and
 - a GIMI validator.
