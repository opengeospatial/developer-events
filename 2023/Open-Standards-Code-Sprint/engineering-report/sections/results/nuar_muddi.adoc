==== NUAR MUDDI logical schema

Sprint participants from Ordnance Survey and the Geospatial Commission sought to examine how a schema that conformed to MUDDI could be created in such a way that it could support data from NUAR. They organised their code sprint work into creation of a backend to store MUDDI-compliant data and a front end to display it. To facilitate the task, they had to transform sample synthetic and anonymised NUAR data into MUDDI-compliant data.

They startd by reviewing the MUDDI conceptual model. All of the feature types in the model were translated associated tables in a database, as illustrated in <<img_nuar_muddi_database>>. They considered the inheritance between feature types, such that tables created from a feature type could inherit properties of its parent feature type.

The figure shows the tables that were created and how they relate to another another. As shown on the figure, there is big table in the middle which ensures that you can record a MUDDI Event type. The sprint participants had to create a relationship table to document relationships between different tables. Another example of a table that had to be created to support representation of MUDDI in a relational model is the accessory tables e.g. for linking conveyance information against network information. The figure has been created using an online tool called dbdocs.io. 

One thing that the sprint participants found unclear in the candidate standard was the relationship between a network, subnetworks, and subordinate networks. The relationships between theses types of networks is illustrated in <<img_nuar_muddi_networks>>. A network is the entirety of the graph consisting of all nodes and edges, as highlighed by the blue oval on the diagram. The subnetwork is a geographic subset of the network, for example one owned by a county. This is illustrated on the diagram through green ovals. There is also a subordinate network which is based on an asset property rather than geographic subsetting.

To demonstrate that sample data conforming to the logical schema could be displayed on a web application, the sprint participants uploaded the data into a pygeoapi instance. The pygeoapi instance was then linked into a web application. A screenshot of the web application is shown in <<img_nuar_muddi_webapp>>.

Future work on the storage aspects of the NUAR MUDDI task could involve using the NUAR MUDDI logical schema as a template for MUDDI compiance. The logical schema does not currently have much attribution about the assets themselves. Therefore any implementation would be expected to  introduce additional attributes.
