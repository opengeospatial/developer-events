=== OWSLib

The OWSLib project implemented client capability for the OGC API - Records - Part 1: Core draft specification.  Support for the "Requirements Class "Map Core" was https://github.com/geopython/OWSLib/pull/847[implemented], reviewed and approved by the OWSLib development team. As a result, Python clients can now use OWSLib for simple Pythonic workflows to request and visualize data from an OGC API - Maps service.

A screenshot of a sample Python/OWSLib workflow of the new functionality is shown in the figure below.
